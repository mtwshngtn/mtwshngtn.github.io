Rocket Launch Heartrate
=======================

During my time at SpaceX I was fortunate to see several rocket launches with everyone in the main building at Hawthorne. I used Fitbit heartrate data and added markers of significant events based on [the official webcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aY-0uBIYYKk) and the launch timeline posted [on SpaceflightNow](https://spaceflightnow.com/2018/04/16/falcon-9-launch-timeline-with-tess/). Visualization and data manipulation is done with Bokeh and pandas.

For reference, my resting heartrate is typically between 68-73 bpm.
