Rocket Launch Heartrate
=======================

When I was at SpaceX I was fortunate to see several rocket launches with everyone in the main building at Hawthorne. I used Fitbit heartrate data and added markers of significant events based on the official webcast and the launch timeline posted [on SpaceflightNow](https://spaceflightnow.com/2018/04/16/falcon-9-launch-timeline-with-tess/). Visualization and data manipulation is done with Bokeh and pandas.
